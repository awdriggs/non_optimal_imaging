# Non-Optimal Imaging

This project explores how “non-optimal” digital cameras can be used to critically analyze photography. Each camera is missing one or more of the key affordances of a modern camera. By reintroducing limitations we can begin to understand our collective and individual relationships with photography at a moment when photography itself is being rapidly reshaped by machine learning.
